# Google Tag Manager Setup Instructions

## Installation Complete! ✅

The Google Tag Manager has been successfully integrated into your prediq.fun site with the following optimizations:

### What was implemented:

1. **GTM Components** (`/src/components/GoogleTagManager.tsx`)
   - Optimized head script using Next.js Script component with `afterInteractive` strategy
   - Body noscript fallback for users without JavaScript

2. **Dynamic Route Detection** (`/src/components/GTMWrapper.tsx`)
   - Client component that detects the current pathname
   - Automatically excludes all `/admin` routes from tracking
   - No GTM scripts load on admin pages for better performance and privacy

3. **Root Layout Integration** (`/src/app/layout.tsx`)
   - GTM wrapper components added to both head and body
   - Conditional rendering based on environment variable

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID` to `.env.example`
   - Updated env validation schema in `/src/env.js`

### To complete the setup:

1. Add your GTM ID to your `.env` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID="GTM-XXXXXXX"
   ```

2. Replace `GTM-XXXXXXX` with your actual Google Tag Manager ID

3. Restart your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Features:

- ✅ Optimized loading with Next.js Script component
- ✅ Automatic exclusion of `/admin` routes
- ✅ Type-safe environment variable validation
- ✅ Works with both light and dark modes
- ✅ Compatible with internationalization (all locales)
- ✅ No performance impact on admin panel

### Testing:

1. Open Chrome DevTools > Network tab
2. Visit any non-admin page (e.g., homepage)
3. Search for "gtm.js" - it should load
4. Visit any `/admin` page
5. Search for "gtm.js" - it should NOT load

The GTM container will now track all user interactions on your prediction market platform, except for admin areas!
